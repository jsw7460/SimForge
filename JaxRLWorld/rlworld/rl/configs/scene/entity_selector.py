"""Sim-agnostic selector pointing at an already-spawned entity (or its
joints / bodies / geoms / sites).

This is **not** the same as :class:`EntityCfg` in
:mod:`unified_entity_config` — that one is a *spawn spec* (recipe used
at scene-build time), whereas :class:`SceneEntitySelector` is a
*runtime pointer* used by event/reward terms to address parts of an
entity that already lives in the scene.

Pattern syntax: ``joint_names`` / ``body_names`` / ``geom_names`` /
``site_names`` accept regular expressions (the same convention used by
mjlab and IsaacLab — :func:`re.fullmatch` against each candidate name).
``"FR_foot_collision"`` matches exactly; ``".*foot.*"`` matches any
name containing ``foot``; ``".*/FR_foot_collision"`` matches Newton's
``shape_label`` paths.

Resolution is performed by ``World.resolve_selector(selector)`` which
returns a :class:`ResolvedEntity` containing both canonical-order joint
indices (aligned with ``RobotData.joint_pos``) and any sim-native
indices needed by backend-level event terms.
